This project is meant for introduce C programming to first year IT students. I am building a "neural nod" that can learn and identify colours. 

Main objectives:
	1. Compilation
	2. Programming Structure and Style
	3. Variables and Data Types
	4. Arithmetic Operators
	5. Standard Input and Output
	6. Controlling Program Flow
	7. Functions
	8. Variable Scope
	9. Libraries
	10. Number systems. Hexadecimal, decimal, binary numbers
	11. Bitwise Operators, Shift Operators and Bitwise Not
	12. Arrays
	13. Pointers
	14. Memory allocation
	 
Extra objectives:
	1. Computer architechture. 
		a. How does CPU work.
		b. How does memory.
		c. How does ...
	2. Using git/github for version control of the development.
	3. Using make/cmake for management of the build process.
